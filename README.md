# Predicting Customer Purchase Value

A machine learning project focused on building a regression model to predict the monetary value of customer purchases.

## üåü Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data science project aimed at predicting the purchase value of customers. By analyzing historical transaction data and customer behavior, this project develops a predictive model that helps businesses forecast revenue, optimize marketing strategies, and personalize customer experiences. The model provides insights into which factors most influence a customer's spending, allowing for more informed business decisions.

The key stages of this project include:

- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Handling missing values, standardizing data, and preparing it for model training.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to uncover patterns and relationships between customer attributes and purchase value.

- Feature Engineering: Creating new features from raw data (e.g., is_purchase, average purchase frequency) to improve model accuracy.

- Model Training and Evaluation: Building and training various regression models and evaluating their performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## üìä Dataset

The project relies on a dataset of customer transaction and behavioral data. While the specific dataset is hypothetical, it would typically contain features such as:

- Customer Demographics: age, gender, location.

- Purchase History: number_of_purchases, total_items, last_purchase_date.

- Website Behavior: time_on_site, pages_visited, product_category_views.

- The Target Variable: purchase_value (the total amount spent in a single transaction or over a period).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Skills

- Python: The core programming language.

- Pandas & NumPy: For efficient data manipulation and numerical operations.

- Scikit-learn: The main library for building, training, and evaluating regression models.

- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

- Regression Analysis: The fundamental machine learning technique applied in this project.

- Jupyter Notebooks: For an interactive development environment.

- Git & GitHub: For version control.
